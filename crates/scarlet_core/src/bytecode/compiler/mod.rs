//! AST → [`Program`]: orchestrates Hindley–Milner type inference and bytecode
//! emission.
//!
//! Function bodies go through the Core IR pipeline: the fused
//! [`Compiler::compile_expr`] walk runs first for type inference (a type that
//! unification just resolved is immediately available so `lower` can pick
//! typed opcodes — `AddInt` over `Add` — and pattern codegen can consult
//! variant layouts), then the typechecked body is lowered to
//! [`crate::core_ir`] ANF, run through Core→Core passes (Perceus reuse, later
//! mode inference), and finally emitted by `core_ir::emit`. Type erasure
//! happens exactly once at Core→bytecode. See [`Compiler::compile_fn_body`]
//! and `docs/core-ir-spec.md`.
//!
//! Module top level is the exception: declarations are mutually
//! recursive and order-free, so `analysis.rs` runs its multi-pass declaration
//! analysis first and hands each body back to this file.
//!
//! # Map of the module
//!
//! - **This file** — [`Compiler`] + entry points ([`compile`] / [`check`] /
//!   [`check_as_module`]): all codegen, scoping, and inference state in one
//!   struct, documented field by field; the pass itself (`compile_node` /
//!   `compile_expr` and friends, one method per AST form); and the Core IR
//!   orchestration ([`Compiler::compile_fn_body`]), the `lower → perceus →
//!   emit` pipeline hook for function bodies.
//! - **`patterns.rs`** — pattern type-checking (no codegen):
//!   [`Compiler::type_pattern`] plus constructor lookup and argument
//!   slotting.
//! - **`bridges.rs`** — the `EmitCtx`/[`ElabCtx`] impls through which the
//!   compiler-agnostic Core IR passes speak to this compilation.
//! - **`tests.rs`** — the unit-test modules.
//!
//! The LSP/workspace layer that owns a `Compiler` across edits —
//! [`IncrementalSession`], [`Watermark`]/`reset_to`, and the reference-graph
//! finalization — lives in [`super::session`]; the peephole superinstruction
//! pass lives in [`super::peephole`].
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Every constant `Value` is built through the compiler's
//!   `FrozenBuilder` handle (the `const_*` helpers), never a bare `Value`
//!   constructor, so all constants live in the program's frozen area and
//!   stay valid for the program's life on any thread.
//! - Everything a compile appends to (inference pool, type env, code,
//!   functions, constants) stays append-only between module boundaries;
//!   that is what makes `Watermark` rollback pure truncation.
//! - Local scoping is undo-log based (`undo_log` / `scope_marks`): popping
//!   a scope replays only the bindings it actually shadowed, never a map
//!   snapshot.
