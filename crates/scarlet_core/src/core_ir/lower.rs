//! Typed IR → Core IR.
//!
//! [`lower`] turns a [`TypedProgram`] into a [`CoreProgram`]: every
//! subexpression becomes a `Let{bind,rhs,body}`, so evaluation order is an
//! explicit right-nested spine and every operand is a [`LocalId`].
//!
//! Lowering is total. It takes `&TypedProgram` and returns `CoreProgram` with
//! no `&mut` and no `Result`, because everything it would have to ask for is
//! already a field: a type is an [`RTy`], a name is a [`ValueRef`], a callee is
//! a [`TypedCallee`]. Upstream is not total, though: a broken invariant reaches
//! [`crate::typed_ir::elaborator_bug`], which aborts rather than diagnosing.
//!
//! ## Builder discipline
//!
//! ANF construction is inside-out: recursing into a subexpression yields the
//! `LocalId` its value lands in plus a list of `Let`s to prepend. [`Lower`]
//! accumulates those in `spine` and [`Lower::seal`] folds them around the
//! eventual tail. Join points (`If`/`Match`) seal each arm on its own so no
//! `Let` floats across a branch.
//!
//! ## Joins in operand position
//!
//! An `if`/`match`/short-circuit where a value is needed lowers via
//! [`CoreExpr::LetJoin`]: sealed as its own tree whose `Tail`s produce a value,
//! then bound like any other operand.
//!
//! A `Let`/`Seq` spine is not one of those. It is straight-line code, so
//! [`Lower::atom`] splices its bindings onto the enclosing spine. Sealing it as
//! a join would bind the value twice and hand `Perceus` the join's type rather
//! than the value's, turning a shaped `Drop` into a generic one.
//!
//! ## Whole-program, one pass
//!
//! `lower` walks `TypedProgram::fns` in order, so `CoreProgram::fns[i]` is the
//! body of `FuncIdx(i)` and every `TypedCallee::Known(i)` operand is already
//! correct.
//!
//! ## The elaborator owns the constant pool
//!
//! Interning is a mutation, so `lower` does none: it copies the pool verbatim
//! and every `Atom::Const` names a [`ConstId`] read off the node. Even integers
//! no source literal spells (an array pattern's length, a `<<>>` walk's bit
//! cursor) are pooled at elaboration time, so the pool is final by construction.
