//! Core → bytecode.
//!
//! [`emit`] walks a [`CoreFn`]'s ANF spine into a flat `Vec<Instruction>` plus
//! the frame's slot count. Type erasure happens here and only here.
//!
//! Jump targets are **function-relative**: every jump operand (and the
//! `SwitchTag` table base) indexes the returned `code` vector, so emit never
//! spells an absolute `program.code` address.
//!
//! Relocation keys off the *frame*, not the splice. The VM resolves a jump as
//! `Function.code_start + operand`, so a block needs [`relocate`] exactly when
//! its frame's `code_start` differs from where the block is spliced. A
//! function body never does; the module toplevel always does, since it runs in
//! the entry frame whose `code_start` is 0 while the block starts at `base`.
