//! NaN-boxed runtime value over per-process arena heaps.
//!
//! `Value` is an 8-byte word. A non-quiet-NaN bit pattern is a plain `f64`;
//! `Value::float` clamps every non-finite input to `0.0`, so a real NaN never
//! enters the box and the whole qNaN space is free for tagging. A tagged value
//! sets the qNaN bits, discriminates on the top 16 bits, and carries a
//! sign-extended small int, a bool, a socket id, or a raw arena pointer in the
//! low 48 bits. Integers outside that range spill to an arena `BigInt`.
//!
//! # Arena object layout
//!
//! A mortal object is `[rc word][header word][payload words…]` and a `Value`
//! points at the *header*, so every header-relative offset is layout-stable.
//! Frozen (immortal) objects have no rc word.
//!
//! Header bits, low first:
//!
//! ```text
//! bit 0      header marker, always 1 (objects are 8-byte aligned, so a read
//!            of a freed or zeroed slot trips the accessors' debug guard)
//! bits 1-5   HeapTag
//! bit 6      off-heap: the payload owns an `Arc` — a Binary's byte backing,
//!            or an owning Subject's closer — released when the box is freed
//! bit 7      immortal: lives in the frozen area, never reference counted
//! bits 8-63  payload length in words
//! ```
//!
//! Payload layouts:
//!
//! - `BigInt`:    `[i64]`
//! - `Range`:     `[start][end]`
//! - `Str`:       `[byte_len][UTF-8 bytes inline, zero-padded to a word]`
//! - `Binary`:    `[arc_data_ptr][arc_len][bit_offset][bit_len]` — the bytes
//!   stay off-heap in an `Arc<[u8]>` shared across views/spawn/migration
//! - `Tuple`:     `[count][elements…]`
//! - `Enum`:      `[type_id | variant_idx<<32][hash][enum_name][variant_name][labels][count][payload…]`
//! - `Closure`:   `[func_idx][count][captures…]` — no name; printers resolve
//!   it through `program.functions[func_idx]`
//! - `Seq`:       `[len][shift][head][tree][tail]` — persistent-vector root
//! - `SeqLeaf`:   `[count][elements…]`, 1..=32 elements
//! - `SeqBranch`: `[count][shift][cumulative sizes × count][children × count]`
//! - `Subject`:   `[mailbox_id][closer_arc_ptr]` — the owner's handle on a
//!   mailbox; freeing it closes the mailbox. Copies are the immediate form.
//!
//! # Reference counting
//!
//! `Value` is not `Copy`: cloning a heap value increments its count, dropping
//! decrements and frees at zero. Freeing walks an explicit work list, so a
//! deep list cannot overflow the native stack. The graph is acyclic by
//! construction (immutable values, capture by value, frame-based
//! self-reference), so there is no cycle collector. [`Arena::alloc_words`] is
//! infallible and non-moving, so a `Value` in a Rust local is never
//! invalidated by a later allocation.
//!
//! All `unsafe` in the value representation is confined to this file behind
//! typed accessors; `seq` and `hamt` go through the views and builders here.
//! The escape hatches for `heap::proc_heap` are `for_each_child_slot` (the one
//! layout table for tracing; its `&mut` face demands exclusive ownership, so
//! only the shared [`Value::for_each_child_ref`] may walk immortal objects)
//! and `binary_clone_backing` (a subject box is never copied: `as_subject`
//! gives the copier the immediate to use instead).
